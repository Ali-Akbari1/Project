Critical Thinking Questions Chapter 8

1. Classes that are derived from existing classes are known as an is-a relationship. A class that contains class member variables is known as a has-a relationship. Is-a is based on inheritance while has-a relationships are based on relationships with other classes.


2. Both methods will be available to an object of the derived class.


3. Abstract methods come from abstract classes however to override a method you do not have to be in an abstract class. Abstract methods have to implement all the behaviours of the parent class. While overriding methods is not mandatory.


4. Abstract classes can have either abstract or non-abstract methods while an interface can only have abstract methods. Interfaces can not be inherited but can be implemented by any number of classes. 


6. a) Abstract method. 


b) Wo is an interface. 


c) Wo is an interface and therefore to use the methods it has you have to implement Wo. 


d) doThat(), doThis(), doNow(), 


e) doThis() will now return 10 because Roo overrides Bo. 


f) Makes z = 1 in Bo. 


g) doThis() method in Bo can be called by using super.doThis()


h) A method in Roo can call doThis() method by using super.doThis()
